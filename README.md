# React E-Commerce Simulation

## Project Description  
This is a simple **React project** built during a **Google Developer Student Clubs workshop**. The primary goal was to learn and implement **localStorage** in a practical scenario. The project simulates an **e-commerce website** with shopping cart functionality and a login page for security, leveraging **React's component-based architecture**.

---

## Project Purpose  
- To understand and implement **localStorage** for persisting data across browser sessions.  
- To practice building a dynamic and interactive user interface using **React**.  
- To gain hands-on experience with React's state management and component lifecycle.

---

## Features  
- **Login Page**: Users are required to log in before accessing the store. This feature is implemented using **localStorage** to ensure secure access.
- **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Users can add items to the cart, view cart contents, and remove items.  
- **localStorage Integration**: Cart data and login information are persisted even after the page is refreshed.  
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.

---

## Technologies Used  
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing components.  
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.  
- **localStorage**: For persisting data across sessions and implementing login functionality.
